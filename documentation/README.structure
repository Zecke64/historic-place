Historic.Place projects lives somewhere in th directory, let's call it <hproot>. 
Let's assume the web server is Apache 2.4 as on the original web site.
H.P consists of a web site and surrounding scripts and config files. The web site lives under
<hproot>/htdocs. It is important that Apache points to this directory as document_root.
The website itself makes use of one server side PHP scripts. These can access everything
under <hproot> via filesystem calls to "../*". By doing so, the server side scripts can
e.g. have access to secret API keys for foreign image hosters, lying in the <hproot>/config directory. Even if the source code is public, nobody can access the keys from the web.
